 This document is the programmer's reference for the Direct Manipulation ListBox (DMLB) 
 control. For more information on programming with this control, see OS/2 Developer 
 Magazine, Nov/Dec 1995. 

 Acknowledgments 
 This control was originally conceived at IBM Yorktown Research by Alan Warren. The 
 control was rewritten and enhanced by Mark McMillan of IBM, Research Triangle Park, USA. 

 Description 
 The Direct Manipulation ListBox is a very useful enhancement for the standard PM 
 listbox control.  It supplies the capability to support drag/drop reordering of items in a 
 listbox, and drag/drop of items from one listbox to another.
