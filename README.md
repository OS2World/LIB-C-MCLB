# LIB-C-MCLB
MultiColumn ListBox (MCLB) PM control.

The MultiColumn ListBox is a very useful PM custom control designed to overcome some of the limitations of the standard PM listbox and container controls.  It is simpler and in many cases faster than a container, but provides multicolumn (tabular) support for display of column-oriented data. 

The MCLB supports individually sizable columns, optional horizontal scroll bars at the base of each column, seperate font and color support for the titles and column data, owner-drawn lists, and a simple listbox-style programming model. 

The MCLB can be subclassed with the DMLB (Direct Manipulation ListBox) function also  supplied in this toolkit to provide drag/drop reordering capability to the MCLB.
