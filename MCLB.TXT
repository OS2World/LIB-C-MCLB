 This control was originally conceived at the IBM United Kingdom Warwick Development 
 group by Charles Cooper.  The control was rewritten and enhanced by Mark McMillan of IBM, 
 Research Triangle Park, USA. 

 Description 
 The MultiColumn ListBox is a very useful PM custom control designed to overcome some 
 of the limitations of the standard PM listbox and container controls.  It is simpler and in 
 many cases faster than a container, but provides multicolumn (tabular) support for display of 
 column-oriented data. 

 The MCLB supports individually sizable columns, optional horizontal scroll bars at the base 
 of each column, seperate font and color support for the titles and column data, owner-drawn 
 lists, and a simple listbox-style programming model. 

 The MCLB can be subclassed with the DMLB (Direct Manipulation ListBox) function also 
 supplied in this toolkit to provide drag/drop reordering capability to the MCLB.
